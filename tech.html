        Engineering Constraints, Operating Environment, Design Approach of Quantum Circuit and Classical Network, Integration and Testing, Design Result with UML diagrams and bar graph of Simulated Results, and notes on Future Works."> 
        <p class="tech_p">What to even say about this. Spent a year working on this project with three other very intelligent individuals. We simulated a quantum network. 
            This in reality was us creating a quantum circuit that demonstrated quantum teleportation and sending that information over a classical network. We choose this approach due to constraints with the 
        language, tools, and ultimately the budget we had. I was primarily in charge of project management and system integration. This means I made sure we were meeting our deadlines and was behind the scenes stitching all
        the pieces together</p>

        <p class="tech_p">This was for a class I took, 422x: Coding on the cloud. I completed this project from start to finish in seven days and I am very proud of how it turned out. The project was completed using django/python and hosted on aws to utilize their RDS and Ec2 services.
            Unfortunately due to the prohibitive costs of aws this clone is no longer live

        <p class="tech_p">I started this project during the summer of 2020. This application was intended to be a journal application to facilitate "system" communication for individuals with DID. This was coded in C# using Xamarin forms and .Net. I utilized a number of nuget packages, my favorite of which was Magic Gradients, and as you can see from the image, the resulting gradients one can make are spectacular.
            Unfortunately, this project was never finished, however, I did manage to learn a lot from this project, and it did land me an internship at Emerson Automotive Soultions in Eden Prairie, Mn
